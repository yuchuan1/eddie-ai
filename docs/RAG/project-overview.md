# Project Overview: PDF-Powered Q&A with Llama 3.1

**Objective:**
Develop an application that allows users to ask questions about multiple PDF documents' content, leveraging Llama 3.1's capabilities to process and synthesize information from these PDFs.

## Technology Stack

### Backend (Python)

- **Language Model:** Llama 3.1 (fine-tuned for Q&A)
- **Framework:** LangChain (orchestrates LLM workflows and document processing)
- **PDF Processing:** PyPDF2 (text extraction)
- **Embeddings & Vector Database:** Sentence Transformers (embedding generation), ChromaDB (storage and search)

### Frontend (Angular)

- **Functionality:** Interface for uploading PDFs and conducting Q&A.

### Deployment (Docker)

- **Purpose:** Simplify deployment and ensure environment consistency.

### Development Environment

- **Hardware:** MacBook Pro M1 Max

## Workflow

1. **PDF Upload:** Users upload multiple PDFs via the Angular frontend.
2. **Content Extraction and Processing:**
   - Extract text using PyPDF2.
   - Chunk text with LangChain.
   - Generate embeddings with Sentence Transformers.
   - Store embeddings in ChromaDB.
3. **Question Answering:**
   - Users input questions through the frontend.
   - Generate question embedding.
   - Perform semantic search in ChromaDB.
   - Construct prompts with retrieved context.
   - Generate answers using Llama 3.1.
4. **Answer Display:** Present answers on the frontend.

## Key Features

- **PDF-Based Knowledge Base:** Utilize content from multiple PDFs for Q&A.
- **Semantic Search:** Efficient retrieval of relevant information using embeddings.
- **LLM-Powered Responses:** Generate insightful answers with Llama 3.1.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simplified upload and Q&A process.
- **Flexible Deployment:** Easy containerization with Docker.

## Development Challenges
