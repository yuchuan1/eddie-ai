# Project Requirements Document

**Project Name:** PDF-Powered Q&A with Llama 3.1

**Document Version:** 1.0


**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the requirements for a PDF-powered question answering system that utilizes Llama 3.1 as its core language model. The system will enable users to upload PDF documents, build a searchable knowledge base, and ask questions related to the content of those PDFs.


**2. Goals and Objectives**

* **Goal:** To develop a user-friendly application that allows users to extract insights from multiple PDF documents by asking questions in natural language.


**3. User Stories**

* As a user, I want to be able to upload multiple PDF documents to the system.
* As a user, I want the system to automatically extract text content from the uploaded PDFs.
* As a user, I want to be able to ask questions about the content of the uploaded PDFs in natural language.
* As a user, I want the system to provide accurate and relevant answers to my questions.
* As a user, I want the system to be responsive and provide answers quickly.
* As a user, I want the system to be easy to use and navigate.
* As a system administrator, I want to be able to easily deploy and manage the application.
* As a compliance officer, I want the system to evaluate applications against environmental regulations and provide a clear compliance status with reasons for non-compliance.


**4. Functional Requirements**

* **PDF Upload:**
    * **FR-1:** The system shall allow users to upload multiple PDF documents simultaneously.
    * **FR-2:** The system shall support PDF file format.
    * **FR-3:** The system shall handle invalid file uploads gracefully (e.g., incorrect file type, corrupted files).
* **Knowledge Base Creation:**
    * **FR-4:** The system shall automatically extract text content from uploaded PDF documents.
    * **FR-5:** The system shall divide the extracted text into semantically meaningful chunks.
    * **FR-6:** The system shall generate text embeddings for each chunk using a suitable embedding model.
    * **FR-7:** The system shall store the embeddings and corresponding text chunks in a vector database (e.g., ChromaDB).
* **Question Answering:**
    * **FR-8:** The system shall allow users to enter questions in natural language through a text input field.
    * **FR-9:** The system shall generate a text embedding for the user's question.
    * **FR-10:** The system shall perform a semantic search against the knowledge base to retrieve the most relevant PDF segments based on embedding similarity.
    * **FR-11:** The system shall construct a prompt for the Llama 3.1 language model, including the user's question and the retrieved relevant context.
    * **FR-12:** The system shall send the prompt to Llama 3.1 and receive the generated answer.
    * **FR-13:** The system shall display the answer to the user in a clear and concise manner.
* **User Interface:**
    * **FR-14:** The system shall provide a user-friendly web interface.
    * **FR-15:** The interface shall allow users to easily upload PDF documents.
    * **FR-16:** The interface shall display a list of uploaded documents with relevant metadata (e.g., file name, upload date).
    * **FR-17:** The interface shall provide a text input field for users to enter their questions.
    * **FR-18:** The interface shall clearly display the answer generated by the system, potentially highlighting relevant sections from the original PDF documents.
* **Deployment:**
    * **FR-19:** The system shall be packaged using Docker for easy deployment to various environments (e.g., cloud platforms, on-premise servers).

**5. Non-Functional Requirements**

* **Performance:**
    * **NFR-1:** The system shall respond to user queries within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., <5 seconds for simple queries, <60 seconds for complex queries with a large number of documents).
    * **NFR-2:** The knowledge base creation process shall be efficient, especially when handling a large number of PDF documents.
* **Scalability:**
    * **NFR-3:** The system shall be able to handle a growing number of users, PDF documents, and user queries without significant performance degradation.
* **Security:**
    * **NFR-4:** The system shall implement appropriate security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
* **Usability:**
    * **NFR-5:** The user interface shall be intuitive and easy to navigate for users with varying levels of technical expertise.
* **Maintainability:**
    * **NFR-6:** The system shall be designed for easy maintenance and updates, with well-structured code and clear documentation.

**6. Technology Stack**

* **Programming Languages:** Python (backend), TypeScript (frontend)
* **Frameworks:** Angular (frontend), LangChain (backend)
* **Libraries:** PyPDF2, Sentence Transformers, ChromaDB, Llama 3.1 Python bindings
* **Deployment:** Docker
* **Development Environment:** MacBook Pro M1 Max

**7. Open Issues and Decisions**

* **Specific Embedding Model:**  The exact Sentence Transformers model to be used for generating embeddings needs to be determined based on performance and accuracy considerations.
* **Fine-tuning Llama 3.1:**  A decision needs to be made on whether to fine-tune Llama 3.1 on a domain-specific Q&A dataset for improved accuracy.
* **Scalability Strategy:** A detailed scalability strategy may need to be developed if the application is expected to handle very large numbers of users or documents.

**8. Appendix (Optional)**

* Glossary of Terms
* Relevant Research Papers or Articles
