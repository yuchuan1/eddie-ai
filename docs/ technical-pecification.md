## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Hardware Requirements
- **GPU:** NVIDIA Tesla V100 or equivalent for PyTorch computations for training and inference.
- **Storage:** Minimum 1TB SSD for user images, model weights, and generated content.

### 2.2 Software Stack
- **Frontend:** Angular 13+ for an interactive web interface.
- **Backend:** Python 3.8+ with FastAPI for handling API services.
- **AI Framework:** PyTorch 1.10+, utilized for integrating FLUX.1 [schnell] model.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 User Interface
- Image upload functionality with preview (supporting JPEG, PNG, TIFF formats).
- Text field for generation prompts with autocomplete suggestions.
- Gallery-style area to display generated images with zoom capability.

### 3.2 Image Processing
- **Preprocessing:** Image normalization (resizing to 1024x1024), augmentation (rotation, flipping, color jittering).
- **Postprocessing:** Image resizing, format conversion, optional style transfer.

### 3.3 AI Model Integration
- **Model Loading:** Import pre-trained FLUX.1 [schnell] weights from Google Cloud Storage.
- **Fine-Tuning:** Implement transfer learning on user images using PyTorch Lightning.
- **Generation:** Text-to-image creation based on prompts using the fine-tuned model.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Performance
- Image generation within 5 seconds under typical load (95th percentile).
- Support for 100 concurrent users without performance degradation.

### 4.2 Scalability
- Use Vertex AI Pipelines for handling multiple concurrent user requests and model serving.
- Implement auto-scaling for backend services based on load.

### 4.3 Security
- Implement SSL/TLS for all API communications.
- Use Google Cloud KMS for encryption key management.
- Implement OAuth 2.0 for user authentication.

## 5. Data Management

### 5.1 Data Storage
- **User Data:** Secure storage in Google Cloud Storage, with client-side encryption.
- **Model Data:** Version control using DVC (Data Version Control) for model updates.

### 5.2 Data Flow
1. User uploads images and provides text prompt.
2. Images are preprocessed and stored in Cloud Storage.
3. Fine-tuning job is triggered on Vertex AI.
4. Generated images are post-processed and stored.
5. Results are displayed to the user via the Angular frontend.

## 6. API Specifications

### 6.1 Endpoints
- POST /api/upload: Image upload
- POST /api/generate: Trigger image generation
- GET /api/results/{id}: Retrieve generated images

### 6.2 Authentication
- Use JWT tokens for API authentication

## 7. Testing and Quality Assurance

### 7.1 Unit Tests
- PyTest for backend functionalities.
- Jest for Angular components and services.

### 7.2 Integration Tests
- End-to-end testing using Cypress.

### 7.3 Performance Testing
- Load testing using Locust to simulate concurrent users.

## 8. Deployment

### 8.1 Deployment Environment
- Google Cloud Vertex AI platform for model serving.
- Google Kubernetes Engine for application deployment.

### 8.2 Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- Use Google Cloud Build for automated testing and deployment pipeline.

## 9. Maintenance and Updates

- Weekly security patches and dependency updates.
- Monthly model retraining and performance evaluation.
- Quarterly feature updates based on user feedback.

## 10. Compliance and Ethical Considerations

- Implement GDPR compliance for EU users.
- Conduct regular bias audits on the AI model.
- Provide clear terms of service regarding content generation and usage rights.
